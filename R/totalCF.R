#' @param ret_age OptVar: retirement age, can be set anywhere between 60 and 70 (default: 65)
#' @param w3 OptVar: third pillar portfolio allocation (given either as vector or as matrix with entries) for all years
#' @param c OptVar: fraction of income that is consumed while still working (current assumption: constant)
#' @param c2 OptVar: second pillar savings as fraction of gross income (still missing: health, a-fonds-perdu payments)
#' @param nu2 OptVar: fraction of second pillar savings that is converted to life-long pension
#' @param nu3 OptVar: fraction of third pillar savings that is converted to life-long pension
#' @param c_age GivenVar: the investor's current age (assuming birthday is calculation-day)
#' @param gender GivenVar: gender, 0=male and 1=female
#' @param w0 GivenVar: time c_age wealth that is not disposable, assumption: still available at retirement (no growth or decline),
#' alternatively: expected wealth (that is not disposable) at retirement, stays the same over time
#' @param CF Given Variables: income shocks, such as inheritance (not currrently imlemented)
#' @param li GivenVar: gross labor income at time 0 (in the last year before birthday)
#' @param lg GivenVar: labor growth rate (in real terms, constant)
#' @param c1 GivenVar: first pillar savings as fraction of gross income
#' @param s1 GivenVar: vector consisting of two components: c(number of contribution years at age=c_age,historical average yearly income until c_age)
#' @param s2 GivenVar: savings in second pillar as of t=0
#' @param s3 GivenVar: liquid wealth - invested in the third pillar (current assumption: no tax advantage for third pillar)
#' @param w2 GivenVar: portfolio allocation in second pillar (assumed to be fixed and not influenced by the decision maker)
#' @param rho2 GivenVar: conversion factor in second pillar for regular retirement age
#' @param rho3 GivenVar: conversion factor in third pillar for regular retirement age
#' @param ret GivenVar: investment return scenarios (nominal)
#' @param retr GivenVar: investment return scenarios (real)
#' @param psi optional, spread to take a loan/leverage for third pillar savings
#' @param alpha parameter to choose fraction of wealth NOT consumed during retirement - see file 'Consumption_3p.ods'
#'
#' @return returns a list with three elements:
#' - a matrix of consumptions before and after retirement (dim c_age:122, # of scenarios)
#' - a matrix of wealth after retirement (dim ret_age:122, # of scenarios)
#' - a matrix of wealth before retirement (dim c_age:(ret_age-1), # of scenarios)
