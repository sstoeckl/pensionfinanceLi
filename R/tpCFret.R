#' Third Pillar Cash Flows in retirement
#'
#' Calculate cash flows from third pillar in retirement
#'
#' @param ret_age optional, retirement age, can be set anywhere between 60 and 70 (default: 65)
#' @param c_age the investor's current age (assuming birthday is calculation-day)
#' @param w3 third pillar portfolio allocation (given either as vector or as matrix with entries) for all years
#' @param alpha parameter to choose fraction of wealth NOT consumed during retirement but kept for investment (and subsequent consumption) - see file 'Consumption_3p.ods'
#' @param wealth_at_ret_age lumpsum from second pillar (after tax using `taxCFlumpsum`) plus third pillar (wealth at retirement from `tpCFwork`
#' after taking away fraction of third pillar savings that is converted to a life-long pension _nu2_)
#' @param retr GivenVar: investment return scenarios (real)
#' @param psi optional, spread to take a loan/leverage for third pillar savings
#' @param warnings optional: should warnings be given? (default=TRUE)
#'
#' @return list with two elemnts:
#' -  consumption during pension years (matrix with dim=c(122-ret_age,# of Scenarios))
#' -  Development of wealth during pension years (matrix with dim=c(122-ret_age,# of Scenarios))
