In the following we will describe all parameters that are necessary as input to the program. We will give details on the parameter, specify where it is used, give a possible/feasible range and determine the steps for their simulation for the final output grid of our Machine Learning approach.

# Given Variables

## Given by the user

### Current Age `c_age`

This variable specifies the current age of the user in full years (the algorithm assumes that calculation day = birthday)

* __Possible Range__: 18-70
* __Feasible Range__: 20-60
* __Optimization grid__: Optimally: 18, Steps of 5: 20-50, Steps of 2: 51-60, steps of 1: 61-70. Feasibly: 20:10:60
* __Functions__: Utility `util`, Total CF `TotalCF`, First Pillar CF `fpCF`, Second Pillar CF `spCF`, Third Pillar CF Work `tpCFwork` and Retirement `tpCFret`

* __Checks__: none
* __Open Questions__: none

### Gross Labor Income `li`

This variable specifies the gross labor income in the past year (that ends on calculation day/birthday). If the users labor income changed /is expected to change significantly within the next year, use the new number discounted by `lg` to create an artificial "last year income".

* __Possible Range__: 0-2m
* __Feasible Range__: 50.000-200.000

grow by 2% on average, and the average inflation is expected to be 1%, then `lg=0.01`.

* __Possible Range__: 0-0.2
* __Feasible Range__: 0.01-0.05

### Conversion factor in the third pillar `rho3`

* __Optimization grid__: Requires bounded optimization between -1 and 1. Libor is determined as 1-sum(...)
* __Functions__: Utility `util`, Total CF `TotalCF`, `tpCFret`, `tpCFwork`
* __Checks__: stop if not sum(w3)=1 (guaranteed by modelling of optimization function)
* __Open Questions__: What are the outputs given very extreme values? Shall the weights really be cut at +-100%? 
* __Recommendation for the future__: Allow changing weights modelled by a linearly decreasing allocation to stocks.
* __NOTE__: We allow for leverage. Also, interpret constant weights as average weights over lifetime.


<!-- # Open Question -->

<!-- * Should checks be done only on the highest level (util/totalCF)? ==> Speed/performance issues -->
