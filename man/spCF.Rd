\arguments{
\item{ret_age}{optional, retirement age, can be set anywhere between 60 and 70 (default: 65)}

\item{nu2}{fraction of second pillar savings that is converted to life-long pension}

\item{c_age}{the investor's current age (assuming birthday is calculation-day)}

\item{c2}{second pillar savings as fraction of gross income (still missing: health, a-fonds-perdu payments)}

\item{li}{gross labor income at time 0 (in the last year before birthday)}

\item{lg}{labor growth rate (in real terms, constant)}

\item{w2}{portfolio allocation (assumed to be fixed and not influenced by the decision maker)}

\item{ret}{investment return scenarios (nominal)}

\item{retr}{investment return scenarios (real)}

\item{s2}{savings in second pillar as of t=0}

\item{rho2}{conversion factor in second pillar for regular retirement age}

\item{warnings}{optional: should warnings be given? (default=TRUE)}
}
\value{
List with elements:
- a vector of lumpsum spendings (length = number of scenarios) and
- a matrix with annuity payments starting at ret_age until 122 (rows) with number of columns equal to the number of scenarios
- vector of wealth levels at retirement
}
\description{
Cash Flows are generated for the payment phase of the second pillar, starting at ret_age until 122 because that is when all our
ficticious persons have died. Contributions to the second pillar are doubled by the employer
