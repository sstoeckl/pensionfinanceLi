\title{Third Pillar Cash Flows during savings phase}
\usage{
tpCFwork(ret_age = 65, c_age, w3, free_cf_before_tax, retr, s3, w0,
  psi = 0.015, c)
}
\arguments{
\item{ret_age}{optional, retirement age, can be set anywhere between 60 and 70 (default: 65)}

\item{c_age}{the investor's current age (assuming birthday is calculation-day)}

\item{w3}{third pillar portfolio allocation (given either as vector (constant investment or as matrix with
entries) for all remaining years}

\item{free_cf_before_tax}{remaining cash flow after contributing to first and second pillar}

\item{retr}{investment return scenarios (real)}

\item{s3}{liquid wealth - invested in the third pillar (current assumption: no tax advantage for third pillar)}

\item{w0}{time c_age wealth that is not disposable, assumption: still available at retirement (no growth or decline), alternatively: expected wealth (that is not disposable) at retirement}

\item{psi}{optional, spread to take a loan/leverage for third pillar savings}

\item{c}{fraction of income that is consumed while still working (current assumption: constant)}
}
\value{
list with two elemnts:
-  consumption during savings years (matrix with dim=c(sav_years,# of Scenarios))
-  Development of wealth during savings years (matrix with dim=c(sav_years,# of Scenarios))
}
\description{
Cash Flows are generated for the savings phase of the third pillar, starting at c_age until ret_age
