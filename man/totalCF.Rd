\arguments{
\item{ret_age}{Decision Variable: retirement age, can be set anywhere between 60 and 70 (default: 65)}

\item{w3}{Decision Variable: third pillar portfolio allocation (given either as vector or as matrix with entries) for all years}

\item{c}{Decision Variable: fraction of income that is consumed while still working (current assumption: constant)}

\item{c2}{Decision Variable: second pillar savings as fraction of gross income (still missing: health, a-fonds-perdu payments)}

\item{nu2}{Decision Variable: fraction of second pillar savings that is converted to life-long pension}

\item{nu3}{Decision Variable: fraction of third pillar savings that is converted to life-long pension}

\item{c_age}{Given variable: the investor's current age (assuming birthday is calculation-day)}

\item{gender}{Given variable: gender, 0=male and 1=female}

\item{w0}{Given variable: time c_age wealth that is not disposable, assumption: still available at retirement (no growth or decline),
alternatively: expected wealth (that is not disposable) at retirement, stays the same over time}

\item{CF}{Given Variables: income shocks, such as inheritance (not currently implemented)}

\item{li}{Given variable: gross labor income at time 0 (in the last year before birthday)}

\item{lg}{Given variable: labor growth rate (in real terms, constant)}

\item{c1}{Given variable: first pillar savings as fraction of gross income}

\item{s1}{Given variable: vector consisting of two components: c(number of contribution years at age=c_age,historical average yearly income until c_age)}

\item{s2}{Given variable: savings in second pillar as of t=0}

\item{s3}{Given variable: liquid wealth - invested in the third pillar (current assumption: no tax advantage for third pillar)}

\item{w2}{Given variable: portfolio allocation in second pillar (assumed to be fixed and not influenced by the decision maker)}

\item{rho2}{Given variable: conversion factor in second pillar for regular retirement age}

\item{rho3}{Given variable: conversion factor in third pillar for regular retirement age}

\item{ret}{Given variable: investment return scenarios (nominal)}

\item{retr}{Given variable: investment return scenarios (real)}

\item{psi}{Given variable: optional, spread to take a loan/leverage for third pillar savings}

\item{alpha}{Decision Variable: parameter to choose fraction of wealth NOT consumed during retirement but kept for investment (and subsequent consumption)}

\item{warnings}{optional: should warnings be given? (default=TRUE)}
}
\value{
returns a list with three elements:
- a matrix of consumptions before and after retirement (dim c_age:122, # of scenarios)
- a matrix of wealth after retirement (dim ret_age:122, # of scenarios)
- a matrix of wealth before retirement (dim c_age:(ret_age-1), # of scenarios)

This function calculates the total cash flows (for each scenario and working age/retirement) given all
input parameters needing all previously defined functions
